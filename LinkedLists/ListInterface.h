1. The ADT list maintains its data by position. Each entry in a list is identifi ed by its position, which is given by an
integer, beginning with 1. Thus, the data in a list has an order, but that order is determined by the listâ€™s client, not
the list itself.
2. You can insert a new entry into a list at a position that ranges from 1 to 1 greater than the current length of
the list. Thus, you can insert a new entry before the fi rst entry, after the last entry, or between two current
entries.
3. Inserting a new entry into a list renumbers any existing entries that follow the new one in the list.
4. You can remove an entry that is currently at a position that ranges from 1 to the current length of the list. Thus,
you can remove the fi rst entry, the last entry, or any interior entry.
5. Removing an entry from a list renumbers any existing entries that follow the deleted one in the list.
